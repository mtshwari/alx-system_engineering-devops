# Web stack debugging 

In this projects I am provided with broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack hence making it work.I wrote a script automating
the commands to fix the web stack.

## Tasks

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
